        <h3>My First Blog</h3>
        <p>
          This is my first ever Blog.I think we all must have the courage to
          take risk and pursue our Dreams.It's really important to trust our gut
          feelings. If we feel like pusuing something we must give it a shot.We
          all must understand that it's important to take risks rather than
          regretting it later. <br /><br />While pursuing our Dreams we must do
          it with all our honesty and sincerity. A wise person said 6 months of
          consistency ,dedication and hardwork can lead as 5 years ahead. So
          it's really important to be comfortable with uncomfortable for few
          years so that we can live the Life of our own Dreams.<br /><br />Each
          an every person has the ability to learn new skills if he or she gives
          themselves some time but the only condition is we must show up every
          single day no matter what.In the worst case scenario even if things
          didn't worked out as our plan still we will never have the regret of
          not trying it once. We must always pad ourselves for listening our
          inner voice and making it happen.
